# What is the weather like today?

# It's an ugly day today

# It doesn't look very nice today

# It's such a nice day, Do you have any plan

# I plan to soak in the sun in my own backyard

# I love the sunny weather today

# I think it may rain

# I wish it was a nice day today

# It's really been pouring all day, huh?

# There will be more snow latter

# There's a lot of flog today

# I think it's going to rain later

# Spring is a mild season
