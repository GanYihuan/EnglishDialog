I would never have a dog. I think they are too needy

I'm not really an animal person

Why don't you have any pets?

I'm allergic to fur

My apartment doesn't allow pets

Maybe you could get a hamster, It's so cute

I am not ready for having a pet yet

I want to buy a pet and I don't know if I should buy a dog or a cat

Can you help me out?

I believe dogs demand a lot of time and care

Cat demands less from me

We can keep them in a cage but you have to take care of diet

I heard rabbits litter a lot everyday

Yes. they do. But they can be easily trained about that

I need to go to pets store this morning. I need to buy some dog food.

What a coincidence! I'm going there, too.
